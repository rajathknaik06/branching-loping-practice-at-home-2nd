""" Maria, a class teacher, wants to identify and display the names and marks of students who have passed an exam. The student's marks are compared to a threshold of passing marks. 



Help Maria write a program to store the students' names and marks, check against the passing marks, and display the details of those who passed.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of an integer no_of_students, representing the number of students.

The next 2 Ã— no_of_students lines contain:

A string (name) on the first line of each pair, represents the student's name.
An integer (marks) on the second line of each pair, represents the student's marks.
The last line of input consists of an integer passing mark, representing the minimum mark required to pass.

Output format :
For each student who passes, print their details in the format: {Name} passed with {marks} marks.

If no student passes, the output will be empty."""


students = {}
no_of_students = int(input())
for _ in range(no_of_students):
    name = input()
    marks = int(input())
    students[name] = marks
minimum_pass_marks = int(input())
for name, marks in students.items():
    if marks < minimum_pass_marks:  
        pass
    else:
        print(f"{name} passed with {marks} marks.")
